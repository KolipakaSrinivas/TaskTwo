Nablasol's Front-End Developer Test
Version: 1.3
Last Updated: March 7, 2022
/*****************************************/

1. The test is designed to help understand your Front-end Development Skills using a JavaScript framework.
2. Please store the data in browser's local storage and add validation as needed.
3. We expect the output to be responsive and work across different devices.
4. While doing the tasks, use the common UI/UX principles while converting the designs to modern functional pages.
5. There are layouts for 2 different tasks whose designs have been provided as image files. 

TASK 1:
It's a 6-step form and you can complete any 4 steps. [Reference images: Task1a.png, Task1b.png, Task1c.png]

TASK 2:
It's a 3-step form and you need to build the first 2. [Reference images: Task2a.png, Task2b.png]


*** IMPORTANT NOTE ***
These tasks mimic the kind of work you’d be doing on a daily basis while on the job. It is imperative that you follow the academic honor code and complete these tasks on your own, without taking any help from another person. This is essential because this will help us evaluate how successful you’ll be in this role and we’re sure you definitely do not want to signup for a job where you won’t be successful.
 
The task you’ve been given is a test of your front-end development skills, specifically focused on building responsive, functional pages using JavaScript frameworks (like React, Vue, or Angular). Here's a breakdown of the instructions and what they imply:

### General Instructions:
1. **Use a JavaScript framework**: You're expected to build the project using a JavaScript framework such as React.js, Vue.js, or Angular.
2. **Store data in browser's local storage**: User inputs in the form need to be saved to the browser's local storage (not session storage or database).
3. **Add validation**: The form needs to include input validation (e.g., checking for empty fields, email formats, etc.).
4. **Responsiveness**: The output should be responsive, meaning it should adjust and work well across various screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
5. **UI/UX principles**: Follow best practices for user interface (UI) and user experience (UX), ensuring the forms are intuitive, easy to use, and visually appealing.

### Task Breakdown:

#### **TASK 1 (6-step form, complete 4 steps)**
- You’re asked to build a **multi-step form** with 6 steps in total, but you only need to implement 4 of them.
- Reference images: You’re given image files (`Task1a.png`, `Task1b.png`, `Task1c.png`) that showcase the design of the form. You’ll need to recreate these designs as closely as possible while ensuring functionality.
- The form might ask for typical user details (name, address, etc.), and you’ll need to handle user input across the 4 steps.

#### **TASK 2 (3-step form, complete 2 steps)**
- Similarly, this is another **multi-step form**, but this time with only 3 steps in total. You are required to complete the first two steps.
- Reference images: You’ll need to refer to the design files (`Task2a.png`, `Task2b.png`) and replicate the layout and functionality.
- Again, you’ll likely be dealing with form inputs and ensuring validation and responsiveness.

### Steps to Approach the Task:
1. **Analyze the provided images**:
   - Look closely at the design images provided for each task. Make sure you understand the layout, style, and flow of each form.
   
2. **Set up your environment**:
   - Choose a framework (e.g., React, Vue, Angular).
   - Set up the project (using `create-react-app`, Vue CLI, or Angular CLI).
   
3. **Build the Forms**:
   - **Form Steps**: Use state management to handle the navigation between the different steps of the form (e.g., moving from Step 1 to Step 2).
   - **Input Fields**: Create reusable components for form inputs if needed.
   - **Validation**: Add form validation (e.g., required fields, correct input format, etc.).
   - **Local Storage**: Store user input in local storage so that data persists even when the user refreshes the page.
   
4. **Ensure Responsiveness**:
   - Use CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap, or media queries to ensure that your forms look good on all screen sizes.
   
5. **Test Across Devices**:
   - Test your forms on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) to ensure they are responsive and user-friendly.

6. **UX Considerations**:
   - Make the form easy to navigate, with clear labels, helpful error messages for validation issues, and appropriate spacing.
   - Ensure that the layout is intuitive, and the design matches the provided images.

By following these steps, you can complete the task effectively and demonstrate your front-end development skills.
